<p>The most secure and private browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other browsers claim to be private but they are still tracking your interaction, even if they do it on an anonymous way. Not us, we don't record/track/analytics/remember/share/footprint anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other ad blockers allow their own partners to display ads on the sites you visit. Not us, we block everyone, and our ad blocking system is continuously growing and improving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other apps look away while tracking systems are profiling you for browsing the web. Not us, we block all of them, this not only increases your privacy and security, but also enhances loading speeds of websites dramatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our motto is Browse and Forget.</p>
